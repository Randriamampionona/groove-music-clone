You can use the `touchmove` event to detect a long press in JavaScript. The `touchmove` event is fired when a touch is moved over a certain distance or time threshold. Here's an example code snippet:

```javascript
const touch = document.querySelector('touch');
touch.addEventListener('touchmove', () => {
  if (touch.touches.length > 0) {
    const touchStart = touch.touches[0].screenX;
    const touchEnd = touch.touches[0].screenX;
    const touchMove = touch.touches[0].screenX;
    const touchDistance = touchEnd - touchStart;
    const touchTime = Date.now() - touch.touches[0].timestamp;
    if (touchDistance > 10 && touchTime > 1000) {
      console.log('Long press detected');
    }
  }
});
```

In this example, we are listening for the `touchmove` event on an element with the ID `touch`. When the event is fired, we check if there is at least one touch (using `touches.length > 0`). If there is, we record the starting position of the touch (`touchStart`), and then continue to check the position of the touch (`touchEnd` and `touchMove`) as well as the time since the touch started (`touchTime`). If the touch has moved more than 10 pixels and the time since the touch started is greater than 1 second, we log a message to the console indicating that a long press has been detected.
